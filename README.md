Course work from ECEN 3350 working with NIOS II Assembly

This repository contains the work I completed for an assembly-based class for Electrical Engineers called ECEN 3350: Programming Digital Systems. We programmed in NIOS II to control a DE-10 Lite board with onboard memory, 8-segment led display, etc.
